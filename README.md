# Python Change Calculator

This repository was created to see if the author can independently code python without handholding.
> The idea is very simple, create a function to calculate the change needed to give back the total change need.
> I has to use any value you give it and must be confined to what is in the draw at the moment of calculating.
> - The function must return a dictionary with what is left in the drawer after removing the change, what change need to be provided back, and the total that is still left to give back if there was not sufficient change in the drawer without giving more than a penny.
> - The change cannot be greater than what it is needed.
> - Round to 1 penny if float point gives you 0.005 or greater.
> 
>**For Example:** if the cashier drawer only has 2 quarters ($0.25), 3 dimes ($0.10), 2 nickel ($0.05) and 20 pennies ($0.01) and you need to give change back for $0.75. You only return 2 quarters, 2 dimes and 1 nickel and there is 1 nickel and 20 pennies left in the cashiers drawer.
